My workstation didn’t follow all the main workplace safety rules, because, for example, 
there were dangerous iron objects positioned on the desk, close to where i could hit them.
In addition, the power plug were connected to a power strip also positioned on the desk, 
so it was potentially dangerous. Moreover there was confusion on the cable management, 
so it was possible to hit cables which was under the desk.

Whereas the desk height was right for a correct postural position, 
and also the office chair was designed to keep me comfortable during work.

I didn’t have to follow particular PPE rules, in fact i could wear casual comfortable clothes.

Safety wasn’t a priority for the company, because it’s normal that in the IT field there aren’t particular 
risks or hazards, so they aren’t observant to it.
