# Networking exercises

NIC - HUB - ROUTER - SWITCH - BRIDGE - REPEATER - GATEWAY

1. To connect channels toghether and divide a network into separate segments. -> ROUTER
2. To connect two different networks. -> BRIDGE
3. To connect several cables to single ouput, -> HUB
4. To direct signals to the correct destination. -> SWITCH
5. To improve the quality of degraded signals. -> REPEATER
6. To inspect incoming traffic. -> GATEWAY
7. To provide the connection between the computer and the network cables. -> NIC

PROS OF NETWORKS
- Printers and Scanners can be shared among different computers
- Hardware can be shared among different users, it is faster to install and easier to mantain and upgrade
- users have access to a central store of data
- communication and transport of files across the network is very quick
- secure is improved with the use of passwords, and the works is backed up
- communication across the network is cheaper than software for each standalone computer

CONS OF NETWORKS
- cables and servers can be expensives to install and replace
- a fault with the server will prevent the  whole network from working
- a network manager is needed and can be expansive
- networks are vulnerable to viruses and hackers

## Match each description with the appropriate network topology
1. All devices are connected to a main central node or server. the other nodes are connected to it and to each other through a switch or a hub. **STAR**
2. All devices are connected to a central cable, called the
bus or back bone. There are more than two endpoints which
are created by adding branches to the main section. If data
are being sent between nodes, the others cannot transmit. **BUS**
3. All devices are connected to one another in the shape of
a ring. Each device is connected directly to two other
devices, one on either side of it. Data travel in one direction
using a control signal called token.  **RING**
4. All the nodes of the network are connected to a common
transmission mediums with exactly two endpoints. The data
transmitted is received simultaneously by all the nodes in
the network. **LINE**
5. There is a direct link between all pairs of nodes. There
are multiple paths for data provided by a large number of
redundant links between nodes. **MESH**
6. There are redundant interconnections between network
nodes. Every node has a connection to any other node in
the network. **FULLY CONNECTED**
7. A hybrid type in which groups of star networks are
connected to a linear backbone, like in a a family tree. **TREE**
