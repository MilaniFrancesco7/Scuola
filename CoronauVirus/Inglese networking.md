# Networking exercises

NIC - HUB - ROUTER - SWITCH - BRIDGE - REPEATER - GATEWAY

1. To connect channels toghether and divide a network into separate segments. -> ROUTER
2. To connect two different networks. -> BRIDGE
3. To connect several cables to single ouput, -> HUB
4. To direct signals to the correct destination. -> SWITCH
5. To improve the quality of degraded signals. -> REPEATER
6. To inspect incoming traffic. -> GATEWAY
7. To provide the connection between the computer and the network cables. -> NIC

PROS OF NETWORKS
- Printers and Scanners can be shared among different computers
- Hardware can be shared among different users, it is faster to install and easier to mantain and upgrade
- users have access to a central store of data
- communication and transport of files across the network is very quick
- secure is improved with the use of passwords, and the works is backed up


CONS OF NETWORKS
- cables and servers can be expensives to install and replace
- a fault with the server will prevent the  whole network from working
- a network manager is needed and can be expansive
